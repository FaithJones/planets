Everyone wants to go visit Mars
It's consedered the best place amoungst the stars
The plannet has the two most beautiful moons
That resembel well baked macaroons
The soil is mostly a vibrant red
With the capacity to keep us all fed
Getting there is a bit of a problem
The Solar radiation is rather fearsome
And the absence of cats makes the life loathsome.
During the day its never too hot
To wear fancy space suits and whatnot
And maybe even fancy space top hats. 
But then again, my main concern is still cats.
