Everyone wants to go to Mars
Even though they have no cars
The plannet has two beautiful moons
The sight of which causes so many swoons
The soil is mostly a vibrant red
With the capacity to keep us all fed
Getting there is a bit of a problem
The Solar radiation is rather fearsome
And there are no cats.
During the day its never too hot
To wear fancy space suits and whatnot
