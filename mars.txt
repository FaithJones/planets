Everyone wants to go to Mars
Even though they have no cars
The plannet has two beautiful moons
The sight of which causes so many swoons
The soil is mostly a vibrant red
With the capacity to keep us all fed
Getting there is a bit of a problem
The Solar radiation is rather fearsome
And the absence of cats makes the life loathsome.
During the day its never too hot
To wear fancy space suits and whatnot
And maybe even fancy space top hats. 
But then again, my main concern is still cats.
